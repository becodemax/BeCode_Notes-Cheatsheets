### Security, compliance and identity (10-15%)

#### Security Compliance concepts and methodologies

**Zero Trust Security :**
- Verify explicitly, least privileges and assume breach
- Six Pillars (IDADIN) :
	1. Identities (authentication monitoring)
	2. Devices (infrastructure monitoring)
	3. Applications (usage and access monitoring)
	4. Data (classified, labeled and encrypted)
	5. Infrastructure (versions, configs)
	6. Networks (segmentation, encryption and monitoring)

**Shared Responsibility :**
- Depends on the services provider
- SaaS, PaaS or IaaS
	- Software as a Service
	- Platform as a Service
	- Infrastructure as a Service
- *Always retained by you*
	- Data
	- Endpoints
	- Account
	- Access Management

**Defense in depth :**
- = Defense in multiple layers

**Common threats :**
- Data Breach
- Dictionary attack
- Ransomware
- Disruptive attack

**Encryption/Hashing :**
- Encryption - At rest / In transit
	- Storing data
	- Transiting data
- Hashing
	- Storing hashed passwords

**CIA :**
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

**Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure (CAF) :**
- = Methodology to implement cloud computing and technology for a business
- Lifecycle :
1. Strategy
2. Plan
3. Ready
4. Adopt
5. Govern
6. Manage

#### Concepts of Identity

**Identity as primary security :**
1. Administration
2. Authentication
3. Authorization
4. Auditing

**Identity providers :**
- Create, maintain and manage identities
- Provides authentication services to apps
- External users with Azure AD can automatically connect to infrastructure
	- B2B - Between to Business
	- B2C - Between to Customers

**AD - Active Directory :**
- Hierarchical structure that stores infos about objects on the network
- AD DS - Active Directory Domain Services :
	- Storing directory data and making this data available to network users and admins
- Informations about users accounts :
	- names, passwords, phone numbers, etc.

**Federated services :**
- Allowing user to access services of another trusted domain with the same identity
- "Shared credentials"

**Identity attacks :**
- Passwords bruteforce
- Phishing
- Spear phishing

### Microsoft Identity and Access Management Solutions (30-35%)

**Azure AD Identities :**
- *User* - employees or guests
	- Groups - multiple users with same access needs
- *Service Principal* :
	- Identity used by applications to access Azure resources
- *Managed Identity* -> Identities provided and managed by Azure
- *Device* -> Piece of hardware and infos related to it (type, owner, etc.)

**Hybrid Identity :**
- Password Hash Synchronization (PHS)
	- User connect remotely, synchronizing pwd hash to pwd hash of user's instance on-premises
- Pass-through authentication (PTA)
	- Authenticating directly against Azure AD
- Federated Authentication
	- Degree of trust may vary

**Authentication methods :**
- Best = Windows Hello

**SSPR (Self-Service Password Reset) :**
- Allow user to reset password without admin or helpdesk

**Password protection and management capabilities :**
- Global banned password list (most known weak passwords)
- Custom banned password list (key words like enterprise name, location, etc.)
- Password spray (same)
- Hybrid security (integrated Azure AD password security)

**Windows Hello :**
- Best authentication method
- Credentials are tied to a device and use biometric or PIN
- Windows Hello Convenience PIN :
	- Not backed by asymetric or certificate 
- Windows Hello for Business :
	- Backed by asymetric or certificate
