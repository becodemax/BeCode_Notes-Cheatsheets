## 1. What's a DPU?

- Stands for Data Processing Unit
- Basically a new class of programmable processors like CPU and GPUs
	- CPU : General computing
	- GPU : Accelerated graphics computing
	- DPU : Accelerated Data Processing
- Has it's own OS
- Take the role of the network interface (associated with a SmartNIC)
- Capable of transfering data around computing units at insane speed
- ARM architecture (for NVIDIA)
- In some words : optimized computing unit for data processing.

## 2. How is that useful?

- Offload the CPU from some heavy data processing tasks
- Handle all network data and path processing
	- CPU only does path initialization and exception handling
- Accelerated engines for :
	- Data packet parsing
	- Network virtualization
	- Traffic acceleration for streaming
	- Telecom and storage
	- AI and deep learning
	- Security :
		- Zero-Trust
		- Firewall
		- Root of trust
		- Secure boot
- In some words : 
	- The DPU focuses on workloads as data transfer, data reduction, data analytics and security so the CPU can focus on application tasks.

## 3. How does a computer process data?

### Data Processing :

 - Validation (is it correct?)
 - Sorting (which order?)
 - Summarization (what's the point?)
 - Aggregation (is everyone together?)
 - Analysis (let's take a look at all of this!)
 - Reporting (there you go!)
 - Classification (we might need all of that later!)

Example :

Pierre est allé au supermarché Delhaize de la région de La Louvière pour acheter trois pommes à 0.7€, et deux baguettes à 1.5€.

### Data Processing for computers :

- Collection
- Preparation
- Input
- Processing
- Output
- Storage

Example (from above) :

- Market : Delhaize
- Location : La Louvière
- Customer : Pierre
- Order : 
	- 3 - 0.7€
	- 2 - 1.5€
	- Total : 2.1€ + 3€ = 5.1€

## 4. Real improvements?

- About -30% power consumption
	- More than 5M€ economy for data center (10k servers) over 3y
- Reduced power consumption really noticable on heavy loads
	- Per server : 432W -> 127W (305W economy)
- Increase general computing efficiency :
	- Maximazing compute density
	- Accelerating time to market
	- High availability
- For 2x network throughput, 18 CPU cores free
